          <h2>I Only Want to Use Bitcoin</h2>
          <h4><mdall>June 27, 2019 --- Daniel W. Newman</mdall></h4>
      <blockquote>
          &ensp;&ensp;In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper. Since that time Bitcoin has grown from that single idea, to a multibillion dollar industry. But the meteoritic increase in the price of Bitcoin isn't what interests me the most. Instead, I am excited by the thought of a currency that cannot be inflated or controlled by the whims of any national government; while at the same time being portable and secure. I believe Bitcoin is the way to a stable economic future.</p>
          <p>&ensp;&ensp;Before I get going too fast, I  want to eliminate some confusion surrounding cryptocurrencies. One main confusion is thinking that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme. After all, older users get more money when newer users join. But that is only one part of a pyramid scheme. According to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1998/05/pyramid-schemes">FTC website</a>, pyramid schemes "promise consumers or investors large profits based primarily on recruiting others to join their program, <em>not based on profits from any real investment or real sale of goods to the public.</em>"(emphasis mine) It is true that new users make more money when new users join, but Bitcoin does have a useful product to sell. Bitcoin has the same product to sell that most banks do: a way to store and transfer money. Because Bitcoin offers a valuable service, it is not a pyramid scheme.</p>
          <p>&ensp;&ensp;Now that I have eliminated that confusion, I would like to tell you why Bitcoin is actually better than using a traditional bank. First, Bitcoin does not use a national currency. You might ask what makes a national currency so bad; there are some positive aspects to a national fiat currency. For one thing, you don't have to worry about it being accepted, because everyone is forced to accept it. But that is about where the benefits of a national fiat currency stop. The problems are legion. First, every one is forced to accept it. Second, the government can inflate the currency, causing its value to drop. Third, and probably most importantly, a national fiat currency is tied to the national government. If a national government disappeared, its currency's value would disappear as well. Bitcoin on the other hand, acts as its own currency, so it is not tied to a national government (besides the Bitcoin community).</p>
          <p>&ensp;&ensp;Not only is Bitcoin not subject to national governments, but second, it inflates consistently. This means that the supply of Bitcoin only increases at a set rate. The programing itself decides how much Bitcoin there will ever be. According to <a href ="https://www.bitcoinclock.com">bitcoinclock.com</a>, the Bitcoin network originally added fifty Bitcoin every ten minutes. Every four years the number of Bitcoin issued is halved; so in 2020 the number of Bitcoin issued every ten minutes will drop to 6.25. By 2140 all 21 million Bitcoin will have been issued, and there will be no new Bitcoin. What this all means is that Bitcoin will always be limited. Because of this, Bitcoin will always have a somewhat consistent value.</p>
          <p>&ensp;&ensp;Last, In addition to inflating consistently, Bitcoin is a safe place to store money. Unlike a bank, Bitcoin gives you the keys to your account; and only your keys can unlock your account. You have to trust your bank to give your money to you when you ask for it. But the revolutionary idea behind Bitcoin is that you can keep your money safe without help from another person. Bitcoin can't be hacked or stolen without the key. Bitcoin is a safe way to store money.</p>
          <p>&ensp;&ensp;Bitcoin is an exciting part of the internet that I believe will only grow larger. Bitcoin is superior to national fiat currencies. Because of this, I believe it should replace them.</p>

            <h2>Why I Quit Facebook</h2>
            <h4><mdall>May 3, 2019 --- Daniel W. Newman</mdall></h4>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&ensp;&ensp;Recently,  CNN reported that Facebook has permanently banned certain “dangerous” accounts. Among those banned were Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos. While I don’t necessarily agree with their positions, I do believe that these banned people should have the ability to speak freely on a social media platform like Facebook. More important than the action Facebook took against these specific people today, however, is the consistent pattern Facebook and other media giants like Google and Twitter have shown in censoring views and speech that they believe are “dangerous” (often code for conservative). According to Project Veritas, Facebook has routinely suppressed conservative Facebook pages of those like Steven Crowder, a conservative commentator with a show on Theblaze.com. Because they own their own website, Facebook has every right to suppress any account it wishes. On the other hand, I as a consumer have a similar right to choose whether or not I visit and have an account on Facebook and other liberal social media websites. By visiting Facebook, Instagram(owned by Facebook), Google, and Twitter, we participate in their advertising programs: their primary sources of income.
          For these reasons, I have decided to permanently delete my accounts controlled by these socialist leaning companies. Doing this will somewhat inconvenience me, but this inconvenience is mdall compared to the consequences of letting these companies decide who and what we see, read, and therefore know. I can make a real difference in the United States by not letting these companies have any more of my time, time which profits them; and so can you. I hope you will join me in this inconvenient, but necessary step to protect our nation from truly anti-American sentiments. Now is the time to speak up; now is the time to act. Please pass this on to your friends and delete your account. <a href ="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-delete-facebook-account-2950145">Here are instructions on how to delete your account.</a></p>
