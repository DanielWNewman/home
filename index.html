          <h2>Why I Quit Facebook</h2>
          <h4><small>May 3, 2019 --- Daniel W. Newman</small></h4>
      <blockquote>
          Recently,  CNN reported that Facebook has permanently banned certain “dangerous” accounts. Among those banned were Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos. While I don’t necessarily agree with their positions, I do believe that these banned people should have the ability to speak freely on a social media platform like Facebook. More important than the action Facebook took against these specific people today, however, is the consistent pattern Facebook and other media giants like Google and Twitter have shown in censoring views and speech that they believe are “dangerous” (often code for conservative). According to Project Veritas, Facebook has routinely suppressed conservative Facebook pages of those like Steven Crowder, a conservative commentator with a show on Theblaze.com. Because they own their own website, Facebook has every right to suppress any account it wishes. On the other hand, I as a consumer have a similar right to choose whether or not I visit and have an account on Facebook and other liberal social media websites. By visiting Facebook, Instagram(owned by Facebook), Google, and Twitter, we participate in their advertising programs: their primary sources of income.
          For these reasons, I have decided to permanently delete my accounts controlled by these socialist leaning companies. Doing this will somewhat inconvenience me, but this inconvenience is small compared to the consequences of letting these companies decide who and what we see, read, and therefore know. I can make a real difference in the United States by not letting these companies have any more of my time, time which profits them; and so can you. I hope you will join me in this inconvenient, but necessary step to protect our nation from truly anti-American sentiments. Now is the time to speak up; now is the time to act. Please pass this on to your friends and delete your account. <a href ="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/how-to-delete-facebook-account-2950145">Here are instructions on how to delete your account</a>.
